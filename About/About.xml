Ever wondered just how many points the game used to generate a raid? Are you getting the maximum 10,000 point raids yet? Now you'll know because you can see exactly how many raid points are used to generate every raid and many other types of incidents.

For an even more educational experience, you can also enable a threat points breakdown that shows the details of how the points were calculated, line by line. This option must be turned on in the mod settings first.

For a 1.2-compatible version of the mod with reduced functionality, you can download it from the "1.2-compatibility" branch on GitHub: https://github.com/1trickPonyta/VisibleRaidPoints/tree/1.2-compatibility
